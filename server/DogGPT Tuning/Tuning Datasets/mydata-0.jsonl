I actually brought along a ball & I played fetch with her during this time. There were no other dogs within the dog park at the same time; whenever passing by other dogs on the walk however, Lily did not give me any trouble.

She’s well-trained and walks very well — she stayed close to me whenever crossing the street and sat every time after hearing the “sit” command. We walked all the way to Golden Road Brewing and turned around from there. She seemed pretty tired towards the end of the walk. We did have a close encouter with two other dogs and she barked at them; however, I made sure to keep our distance. Overall, we had a great walk — hope to see Shatna again!"}]}

She peed plenty of times and pooped once. When passing by other dogs/people, she did not give me any trouble. Huntley actually made some new friends at the park — another Golden Retriever and Husky.
